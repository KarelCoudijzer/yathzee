# Yathzee

Yathzee is a game where by throwing 5 dices up to a max of 3 times you try to get some combination. You can onlt select a combintion once and the number on the dices determine the value of your throw. You win the game by getting the most points. A detailed explenation can be found [here][1]

## Goal

The goal is to implement the game in a server-client application using ASP.NET Core C#. The user can play against up to 4 other players/CPU's. The first client will be a react web app. Later on a mobile client will be implemented. The user can resume the game everytime they want, so the state needs to be persisted on the server side.
